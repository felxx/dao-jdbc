# **📝 DAO Learning Project**
This project demonstrates a **basic implementation of the DAO (Data Access Object) design pattern** through the **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API**. It was developed as a learning exercise, guided by Professor Nélio Alves.

### 🎯 Functionality:
The project provides comprehensive CRUD operations for Seller and Department entities, illustrating how to interact with a relational database using JDBC. They are:
- **Find By ID**: Retrieves a department or seller by its ID;
- **Find All**: Retrieves all seller or departments from the database;
- **Insert**: Inserts a new seller or department into the database;
- **Update**: Updates an existing department or seller;
- **Delete**: Deletes a seller or department by their ID.
